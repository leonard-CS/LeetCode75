# Notes for Problem 238
- **Title**: [238. Product of Array Except Self]([problem-link](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/))
- **Description**: Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

# Hint
- Think how you can efficiently utilize prefix and suffix products to calculate the product of all elements except self for each index. Can you pre-compute the prefix and suffix products in linear time to avoid redundant calculations?

# Approach and Solutions

## Approach 1:
- **Description**: First, calculate prefix products (product of elements before each index) and suffix products (product of elements after each index). Finally, multiply the prefix and suffix products for each index to get the result.
- **Complexity**:
    - **Time Complexity**: O(m), where m is the length of the array.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the lenght of the array.
